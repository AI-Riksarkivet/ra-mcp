# Feature Specification: Riksarkivet Historical Document Search and Access System

**Feature Branch**: `001-researchers-historians-and`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Researchers, historians, and AI assistants need a way to search and access millions of transcribed historical documents from the Swedish National Archives (Riksarkivet). Users should be able to search by keywords to find relevant documents, view complete transcriptions with highlighted search terms, browse specific documents by reference codes, and access high-resolution images of original manuscripts. The system should integrate with AI tools through standard protocols so that AI assistants can help users discover and analyze historical content. Users need both a command-line interface for direct access and an API interface that AI systems can use to provide historical research capabilities."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Completed: Feature description parsed successfully
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: researchers, historians, AI assistants as actors
   ’ Actions: search, view transcriptions, browse documents, access images
   ’ Data: transcribed documents, reference codes, manuscripts
   ’ Constraints: integration with AI tools, multiple interface types
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All key aspects are clearly defined in the description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flows are clear from the description
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement derived from user needs
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Documents, transcriptions, images, reference codes
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   ’ Implementation details avoided
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Researchers and historians need to efficiently search through millions of historical documents from the Swedish National Archives to find relevant content for their research. They want to search by keywords, view complete transcriptions with highlighted search terms, browse documents using reference codes, and access high-resolution images of original manuscripts. AI assistants should be able to help users by accessing the same capabilities through standard protocols.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a researcher has specific keywords, **When** they search the document collection, **Then** they receive a list of relevant documents with search terms highlighted in context
2. **Given** a user has a document reference code, **When** they browse that document, **Then** they can view the complete transcription and navigate through pages
3. **Given** a historian needs to see original manuscripts, **When** they request high-resolution images, **Then** they receive quality images suitable for detailed analysis
4. **Given** an AI assistant receives a research query, **When** it accesses the system through the API, **Then** it can search documents and provide historical research assistance
5. **Given** a user prefers command-line tools, **When** they use the CLI interface, **Then** they can perform all search and access functions without a graphical interface

### Edge Cases
- What happens when search terms yield no results?
- How does the system handle requests for documents that don't exist or have restricted access?
- What occurs when high-resolution images are too large to display efficiently?
- How does the system respond when AI tools make rapid successive requests?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow keyword-based search across millions of transcribed historical documents
- **FR-002**: System MUST highlight search terms within document transcriptions and provide contextual snippets
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow browsing of specific documents using reference codes
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide access to complete transcriptions of historical documents
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide access to high-resolution images of original manuscripts
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with AI tools through standard protocols for automated research assistance
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a command-line interface for direct user access
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide an API interface for AI system integration
- **FR-009**: System MUST return search results with relevant metadata including reference codes and page numbers
- **FR-010**: System MUST support navigation through multi-page documents
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle requests from both human users and AI assistants efficiently

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Historical Document**: Represents a document in the Swedish National Archives with unique reference code, transcribed text content, and associated metadata
- **Transcription**: Text content extracted from historical documents, searchable and displayable with highlighting capabilities
- **Manuscript Image**: High-resolution digital image of original historical document pages, linked to transcriptions
- **Reference Code**: Unique identifier system used by Riksarkivet to catalog and locate specific documents
- **Search Result**: Collection of matching documents with highlighted terms, metadata, and relevance ranking
- **User Session**: Represents interaction context for both human users and AI assistants accessing the system
