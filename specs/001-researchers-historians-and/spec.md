# Feature Specification: Riksarkivet Historical Document Search and Access System

**Feature Branch**: `001-researchers-historians-and`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Updated**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Implemented ✅
**Original Input**: "Researchers, historians, and AI assistants need a way to search and access millions of transcribed historical documents from the Swedish National Archives (Riksarkivet). Users should be able to search by keywords to find relevant documents, view complete transcriptions with highlighted search terms, browse specific documents by reference codes, and access high-resolution images of original manuscripts. The system should integrate with AI tools through standard protocols so that AI assistants can help users discover and analyze historical content. Users need both a command-line interface for direct access and an API interface that AI systems can use to provide historical research capabilities."

**Implementation Summary**: The system has been fully implemented with MCP server (`search_transcribed`, `browse_document`, `get_document_structure` tools), CLI interface (`ra search`, `ra browse`, `ra serve` commands), and comprehensive API integrations including Riksarkivet Search API, IIIF, ALTO XML, and historical guide resources.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Completed: Feature description parsed successfully
2. Extract key concepts from description

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Researchers and historians need to efficiently search through millions of transcribed historical documents from the Swedish National Archives to find relevant content for their research. The implemented system allows users to search by keywords with pagination support, browse specific document pages using reference codes, and access document structure information. Both command-line and AI assistants can access these capabilities through implemented interfaces.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a researcher has specific keywords, **When** they use `search_transcribed` with pagination, **Then** they receive structured results with document references and page numbers
2. **Given** a user has a document reference code and page numbers, **When** they use `browse_document`, **Then** they can view complete transcriptions with optional keyword highlighting
3. **Given** a user wants to understand document organization, **When** they use `get_document_structure`, **Then** they receive metadata and manifest information without full content
4. **Given** an AI assistant needs historical research, **When** it accesses the MCP server tools, **Then** it can search, browse, and analyze documents programmatically
5. **Given** a user prefers command-line access, **When** they use `ra search`, `ra browse`, or `ra serve` commands, **Then** they can perform research tasks directly from terminal

### Implemented Edge Cases
- Search pagination handles no results with appropriate offset messaging
- Browse function provides error handling for non-existent pages or reference codes
- Document structure requests validate identifiers and provide helpful error messages
- MCP server includes comprehensive error formatting with actionable suggestions

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **Search Hit**: Individual page result from keyword search with highlighted snippets and document context
- **Document Page**: Specific page within a document containing full transcription text and IIIF image links
- **Reference Code**: Riksarkivet identifier for documents (format: SE/RA/123456/01)
- **IIIF Manifest**: Metadata structure providing document organization and image access via IIIF protocol
- **MCP Tool Response**: Structured data returned by server tools including search results, browse results, or document structure
- **Historical Guide Content**: Markdown documentation providing research context and archival information
